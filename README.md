# Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV

This repository contains a Python script that uses the OpenCV library to perform real-time face detection using the Haar cascade classifier. The script captures video from your computer's camera, detects faces, and displays the video feed with rectangles drawn around detected faces.

## Requirements

- Python (3.6+ recommended)
- OpenCV (install using `pip install opencv-python`)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the `face_detection.py` script.

2. Install the required libraries if you haven't already:

3. Run the script:

4. A window will open displaying the real-time video feed from your camera. Detected faces will be highlighted with rectangles.

5. Press the 'q' key to exit the program.

## Credits

- This script uses the Haar cascade classifier provided by OpenCV for face detection.

.....### Absolutely, you can enhance this code to add more features and functionality .......
.....### Adding required database make it more relevent as per need ////
